\mysec{Research Interests}

My research is centered around developing techniques, tools and environments that help build more reliable and secure software. I am interested in finding solutions that allow programmers to better reason about their code, and that efficiently detect bugs, classify them, and diagnose their root cause. I especially focus on bugs that manifest in production, because they are hard and time consuming. I am also interested in efficient runtime instrumentation, hardware and runtime support for enhancing system security, and program analysis under various memory models.

\item{I developed \textbf{Portend}, a high-accuracy technique to classify data races according to their potential consequences under arbitrary memory models, by using symbolic program analysis to explore multiple program paths and schedules to determine the effects of data races.}
\item{I developed \textbf{Bias-Free Sampling}, a technique that allows efficient sampling of rarely executed code (where bugs often lurk) without over-sampling frequently executed code, by using a new sampling algorithm and existing hardware support.}\\
